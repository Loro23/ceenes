# Ceenes Project
This is a PWA used to identify common interests in a movie within seconds. 
The idea started in Sep. 2020 and we have released the first prototype just yet. 
It is available under [ceenes.com](https://ceenes.com "Ceenes").

## How it works
We used Flutter to realize our Frontend and connect the users input with our firebase Backend to bring together the users common interests.
